<p>This site was created to make the transportation experience more efficient and as enjoyable as possible. As someone who has always lived in cities and relied heavily on car alternatives, I think information provided from locals will be very useful to walkers, bikers, bus riders, rollerbladers, drivers, skateboarders, etc!</p>

<p>The site will be tested in Washington DC and can expand to other cities.</p>
